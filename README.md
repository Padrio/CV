# 📝 My CV - The PDF that could change your life (or just mine)

Welcome to the most exciting GitHub repository you’ll ever find! Okay, maybe not *that* exciting – but hey, it’s got my **resume** in PDF form, which is kind of a big deal. Whether you're a recruiter, a curious developer, or someone who just loves opening PDFs for fun (we don’t judge), you’ve come to the right place!

## 📂 What's inside?

Just one magnificent file:

- `CV.pdf`: The most comprehensive, impressive, and *totally honest* summary of my professional life you’ve ever seen (I promise).

## 🛠 How to use it?

1. **Download** the PDF.
2. **Read** it carefully
3. **Be amazed** by my skills, experience, and general awesomeness.
4. If you’re a recruiter, feel free to **hire me**. No pressure.

## 🔓 License - Do what the heck you want!

This project is proudly licensed under the **WTFPL2 License** – because I believe in freedom, fun, and not taking life (or licenses) too seriously.

### TL;DR:
- Feel free to use, share, or admire my CV.
- Just don’t copy it and claim it’s yours – that would be weird.

## 📢 Important Note

If you decide to print my CV, make sure to:
- Use premium quality paper.
- Frame it (optional but recommended).
- Tell your friends how great it looks.
